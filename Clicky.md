Navigate to the code part of the file via this path and now you could see the c# code for the file.

On clicking button 5, there is a check to ensure that the next button, that is, button 7 is clicked, thereafter it checks if button 3 is clicked and consequentively for button 1. If all this buttons are clicked in the given order, we get the final statement. 


Button 5, 7, 3 and 1 are initialized as 429, 529, 216 and 88.
